17. **Sleeping in college. A recent article in a college newspaper stated that college students get an average of 5.5 hours of sleep each night. A student who was skeptical about this value decided to conduct a survey by randomly sampling 25 students. On average, the sampled students slept 6.25 hours per night. For each statement below, state whether it is TRUE or FALSE.**
   - a) The sample mean is 5.5 hours and the claimed population mean is 6.25 hours.  F
   - b) The sample mean is 6.25 hours and the claimed population mean is 5.5 hours.  T
   - c) There is no sample mean, because the sample is too small.  F
   - d) There is no population mean, because the article fabricated the mean.   F
   - e) The population under study is college students with sleep deprivation.  F
   - f) If the student who conducted the survey, created a poll on a social media platform to gather the data, it is considered random sampling.  F
   - g) If the student who conducted the survey, asked students who were customers at a campus ice cream shop, to answer questions about sleep, it would be considered random sampling.  F

18. **Cats on YouTube. Suppose you want to estimate the percentage of videos on YouTube that are cat videos. It is impossible for you to watch all videos on YouTube so you use a random video picker to select 1000 videos for you. You find that 2% of these videos are cat videos. State TRUE or FALSE for each of the following statements about observations, variables, sample statistics, or population parameters.**

    - a) The 2% of sampled videos on YouTube that are cat videos is the population parameter. F
    - b) The percentage of all videos on YouTube that are cat videos is the population parameter. T
    - c) The number of videos sampled from the population is the population parameter. 
    - a) The 2% of sampled videos on YouTube that are cat videos is the sample statistic. T 
    - b) The percentage of all videos on YouTube that are cat videos is the sample statistic. F

19. **Vitamin supplements. To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not. No statistically discernible differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms. (Audera et al. 2001)  For each of the following statements, state whether it is TRUE or FALSE.**

    - a) This was an observational study.  F
    - b) The explanation for the answer in a) is that no differences were observed between the groups.   F

    - k) There was no blinding in the study because a placebo was used.  F 

        
20. **Screens, teens, and psychological well-being. In a study of three nationally representative large-scale datasets from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom (n = 17,247), teenagers between the ages of 12 to 15 were asked to keep a diary of their screen time and answer questions about how they felt or acted. The answers to these questions were then used to compute a psychological well-being score. Additional data were collected and included in the analysis, such as each child’s sex and age, and on the mother’s education, ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment. Answer TRUE or FALSE for each of the following statements.**

    - a) This was an observational study.  T
    - b) The explanation for the answer in a) is that screen time is an exposure, not an intervention.  T
    - c) The teenagers' diary entries is the intervention.  F
