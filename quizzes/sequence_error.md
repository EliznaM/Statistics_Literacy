# provide 10 post-graduate level statistics multiple choice quiz questions on random error by using examples from sequencing experiments, with 4 options each

MUST GIVE PAPER OR ARTICLE TO READ

Here are **10 post-graduate level multiple choice questions on random error in sequencing experiments**, each with 4 options:

1. **In high-throughput sequencing, random errors are most likely to occur due to:**
    - a) Systematic biases in library preparation
    - b) Intrinsic stochastic misincorporation of nucleotides during sequencing  X
    - c) Consistent base-calling errors at homopolymer runs
    - d) Reference genome inaccuracies
2. **Which of the following best describes the impact of random error on base calls near the ends of sequencing reads?**
    - a) Decreased error rate due to better quality scores
    - b) Increased random error due to lower signal-to-noise ratio    X
    - c) No effect on error rate
    - d) Systematic error dominates at read ends, not random error
3. **In a sequencing experiment with an error rate $p$ per base and coverage $k$, how does increasing $k$ affect the expected number of random errors at a given genomic position?**
    - a) Expected errors increase linearly with $k$
    - b) Expected errors decrease exponentially with $k$
    - c) Expected errors decrease because multiple reads allow consensus calling   X
    - d) Expected errors remain constant regardless of $k$

5. **Random errors in sequencing can be reduced by:**
    - a) Increasing sequencing read depth (coverage)  X
    - b) Using a faulty sequencer repeatedly
    - c) Retaining low-quality reads
    - d) Using a higher quality reference genome

7. **In a sequencing experiment, if each nucleotide has a 5% chance of being incorrectly called independently, what type of error does this represent?**
    - a) Systematic error
    - b) Random error   X
    - c) Bias error
    - d) Calibration error
8. **Which of the following is NOT a typical source of random error in sequencing experiments?**
    - a) Variability in sample preparation
    - b) Instrument noise during base detection
    - c) Consistent misalignment to repetitive regions   X
    - d) Stochastic fluctuations in reagent concentrations
9. **When analyzing sequencing data, random errors manifest as:**
    - a) Consistent variant calls at a specific genomic locus
    - b) Variants appearing sporadically with low frequency across reads   X
    - c) Strand-specific base miscalls
    - d) Systematic deviations from the reference sequence
10. **In the context of sequencing, which approach helps distinguish true variants from random sequencing errors?**
    - a) Increasing the number of biological replicates   X
    - b) Decreasing sequencing read depth
    - c) Ignoring all low-frequency variants
    - d) Ignoring all high-frequency variants
