1. How is a sampling distribution constructed from sample data?  
A) By plotting all individual data points in one sample  
B) By taking many random samples and plotting the distribution of a chosen statistic (e.g., the sample mean) from these samples  X
C) By calculating the median of one large sample  
D) By measuring the population distribution only  

2. What is a probability distribution?  
A) A theoretical distribution based on the likelihood of each possible outcome of a random variable   X
B) A measure of the average of a data set  
C) The distribution of sample means only  
D) The percentage of errors in a sample  

3. The "area-under-the-curve" in a probability distribution represents:  
A) The total number of data points  
B) The total probability, which always equals 1   X
C) The range of values that are impossible  
D) The variance of the data  

4. How does a sampling distribution relate conceptually to the normal distribution and t-distribution?  
A) Sampling distributions are empirical and cannot resemble theoretical distributions, even if conditions of sample size and type of estimate are met  
B) Sampling distributions of certain statistics (like the mean) approximate theoretical distributions such as the normal or t-distribution depending on sample size and conditions  X
C) Sampling distributions are always uniform distributions  
D) The normal and t-distributions are used only for population data  

5. Which statement best describes the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?  
A) Sample means will be exactly equal to the population mean regardless of sample size  
B) The population distribution becomes normal if the sample size is large, regardless of the sample mean distribution  
C) The CLT only applies to data that is already normally distributed, regardless of sample size 
D) Sample means will follow a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population's original distribution  X

6. When constructing a sampling distribution of the sample mean, what happens as the sample size increases?  
A) The distribution becomes more spread out  
B) The mean of the sampling distribution shifts away from the population mean
C) The distribution becomes more tightly clustered around the population mean  X
D) The sampling distribution becomes uniform  

7. Why is the area-under-the-curve concept important in hypothesis testing?  
A) It is used to calculate probabilities of observing the data under the null hypothesis  X
B) It tells the number of standard deviations from the mean  
C) It gives the exact value of the population parameter  
D) It indicates the total number of possible samples and the probability of the alternative hypothesis 

8. Which of the following is NOT true about the Central Limit Theorem?  
A) It allows inference about population parameters using the sampling distribution of the mean  
B) The shape of the sampling distribution approaches normality as sample size increases  
C) It requires the population to be normally distributed  X
D) It supports hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction  

9. If a population distribution is highly skewed, what does the Central Limit Theorem suggest about the sampling distribution of the mean when the sample size is sufficiently large?  
A) It will also be highly skewed  
B) It will approximately be normal despite the population skewness  X
C) It will be uniform despite the population skewness  
D) It will have a larger variance than the population because of the population skewness
