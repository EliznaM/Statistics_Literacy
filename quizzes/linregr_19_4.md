1. A scatter plot shows points closely clustered around an upward-sloping 
fitted line, obtained by correlation analysis. What does this pattern 
most likely indicate?
  
A. A strong positive relationship between variables   X
B. A strong negative relationship between variables
C. No relationship between variables
D. The model is nonlinear

2. In a scatter plot, the fitted line slopes downward and the points are 
widely scattered around the line. What can be concluded?
  
A. A strong positive relationship exists
B. A strong negative relationship exists
C. A weak positive relationship exists
D. A weak negative relationship exists  X

Interpret correlation coefficients
3. A correlation coefficient of r = −0.85 indicates:
  
A. A strong positive relationship
B. A weak positive relationship
C. A strong negative relationship   X
D. No relationship

4. Which correlation value is most likely for a scatterplot where the value on 
the x-axis is always close to double the value on the y-axis for every observation?
  
A. r = −2
B. r = -0.5
C. r = -0.95  X
D. r = -0.45

Interpret the components of the formula for a straight line

5. In the regression equation ŷ = 3.5 + 2.1x, what does 3.5 represent?
  
A. The error term
B. The slope of the line
C. The predicted value of y when x = 0   X
D. The correlation between x and y

6. In the equation ŷ = β₀ + β₁x, what does β₁ describe?
  
A. The average error of prediction
B. The change in y for a one-unit change in x    X
C. The value of y when x = 0
D. The correlation between x and y

7. A residual is defined as:

A. The difference between the observed y and the predicted y   X
B. The fitted line on a scatter plot
C. The slope of the regression line
D. The error in measuring x

8. If a point lies far above the fitted line, its residual will be:
  
A. Close to zero
B. Large and positive   X
C. Large and negative
D. Undefined

8. If a point lies far above the fitted line, the model:
  
A. Overestimates that observation
B. Underestimates that observation   X
C. Excludes that observation as an outlier
D. Overestimates all observations


9. A simple linear regression finds that β₁ = 4.2 with p < 0.01. What does this indicate?
  
A. The slope is not significantly different from zero
B. For every 1-unit increase in x, y increases by about 4.2 units  X
C. The relationship between variables is weak
D. x does not predict y

10. In a simple regression, R² = 0.62. How should this be interpreted?
  
A. 62% of the variability in y is explained by x   X
B. x perfectly predicts y
C. 62% of the variability in x is explained by y
D. The model is not significant

11–12. Interpret a multiple linear regression result
11. In a multiple regression model, the coefficient for 
coefficient for x1 is β1 = 4.2 (p = 0.01) and for x2 is β2 = −1.7 (p = 0.03).
What does this mean?
  
A. x1 and x2 has an effect of 2.5 on y
B. After controlling for other variables, x2 is associated with a decrease in y   X
C. x2 decreases y by 1.7 units, independent of other variables
D. x2 decreases x1 by 1.7

12. A multiple regression model reports R² = 0.80 and adjusted R² = 0.76. 
What is the best interpretation?
  
A. The model likely overfits badly
B. The predictors explain 80% of the variance, and the adjusted R² accounts 
for the number of predictors   X
C. The model explains only 4% of the variance, as the adjusted R² accounts for 
overfitting
D. The predictors are significant as the difference in R² and adjusted R² is 
less than 5%
