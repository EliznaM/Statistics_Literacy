QUIZ FOR STUDY DESIGN, 8.3 Accuracy and precision  

1. **Which statement best defines accuracy in the context of scientific measurements?**
a) How close repeated measurements are to each other
b) How close the average of measurements is to the true or accepted value  X
c) The variability among repeated measurements
d) The number of significant figures in a measurement
2. **Precision in a set of measurements refers to:**
a) The closeness of the measurements to the true value
b) The closeness of measurements to each other, regardless of the true value  X
c) The systematic error in the measurement process
d) The difference between the mean and the reference value
3. **If an experiment produces results that are tightly clustered but far from the true value, the data are:**
a) Accurate but not precise
b) Precise but not accurate  X
c) Both accurate and precise
d) Neither accurate nor precise
4. **According to ISO definitions, what does *trueness* refer to?**
a) The closeness of agreement among repeated measurements

5. **Which of the following best describes the relationship between accuracy and precision?**
a) Accuracy and precision are synonymous in scientific contexts
b) High accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness  X
c) Precision measures systematic error, accuracy measures random error
d) Increasing sample size improves accuracy but not precision

6. **Which one of the following statements is true about sample size, accuracy and precision?**
