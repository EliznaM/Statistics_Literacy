### Random Error and Sampling Distribution

1. What is random error in statistical estimation?  
A) A consistent bias in measurements  
B) Variation in measurements due to chance  X
C) An error caused by faulty equipment  
D) A systematic mistake in data collection

2. Which of the following best describes a sampling distribution?  
A) Distribution of data in a sample  
B) Distribution of population parameters  
C) Distribution of a statistic across many samples  X
D) Distribution of measurement errors

3. How does the sampling distribution relate to confidence intervals?  
A) Confidence intervals represent the width of the sampling distribution 
B) Confidence intervals come from the population distribution, not the sampling distribution  
C) Confidence intervals estimate the variability of the sampling distribution of a statistic  X
D) Confidence intervals have no relationship to the sampling distribution

### P-values and Their Interpretation

4. A p-value represents the probability of:  
A) The null hypothesis being true  
B) Observing the current data, or data more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true  X
C) The alternative hypothesis being true  
D) Making a type 1 error

5. If a p-value is very small (e.g., 0.01), this suggests:  
A) Strong evidence against the null hypothesis  
B) Strong evidence for the null hypothesis  
C) The result is not statistically significant  
D) The sample size is too small

6. Which statement about p-values is true?  
A) A p-value of 0.05 means there is a 5% chance the null hypothesis is true  
B) A p-value measures the probability of observing the sample data  X
C) P-values depend on the assumed null hypothesis and the data observed  
D) Large p-values prove that the alternative hypothesis is false

### Confidence Intervals and Their Interpretation

7. A 95% confidence interval means:  
A) 95% of the time, the sample mean falls within the interval  
B) 95% of the population lies within the interval  
C) If the study were repeated many times, 95% of such intervals would capture the true parameter X
D) There is a 95% probability the parameter is in the calculated interval

8. If a 95% confidence interval for a mean difference includes zero, this implies:  
A) The difference is statistically significant  
B) The null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 5% level  X
C) The true mean difference is zero  
D) The sample size is sufficient for inference

9. Confidence intervals provide which of the following?  
A) Direct proof of the null hypothesis  
B) The exact value of the parameter  
C) A range of plausible values for the parameter  X
D) The probability the data came from the null distribution

### Type 1 and Type 2 Errors

10. A Type 1 error occurs when:  
A) The null hypothesis is true and rejected   X 
B) The null hypothesis is true and not rejected  
C) The null hypothesis is false and rejected  
D) The null hypothesis is false and not rejected

11. A Type 2 error occurs when:  
A) The null hypothesis is true and rejected  
B) The null hypothesis is true and not rejected  
C) The null hypothesis is false and rejected  
D) The null hypothesis is false and not rejected  X

12. Increasing the sample size usually:  
A) Increases the probability of a Type 1 error  
B) Decreases the probability of a Type 2 error X 
C) Increases both Type 1 and Type 2 errors  
D) Has no effect on Type 1 or Type 2 errors

### Multiple Hypothesis Testing and Corrections

13. Why is multiple hypothesis testing problematic?  
A) It increases the number of Type 2 errors  
B) It increases the number of Type 1 errors  X
C) It produces fewer false positives  
D) It simplifies statistical analysis

14. Which of the following is a common multiple testing correction method?  
A) Bonferroni correction  X
B) Linear regression  
C) Median imputation  
D) Principal component analysis

15. What is the main goal of multiple testing corrections?  
A) Increase statistical power  
B) Control the number of false positives  X
C) Eliminate all Type 1 errors  
D) Remove random error from data

16. If no correction is applied when testing many hypotheses, which outcome is most likely?  
A) Increased false positives   X
B) Increased false negatives  
C) The test results become invalid  
D) Decreased statistical power

17. Which statement about Type 1 error and multiple testing is true?  
A) The number of Type 1 errors increases with more tests  X 
B) The number of Type 1 errors remains constant no matter how many tests are done  
C) Multiple testing reduces the chance of a Type 1 error  
D) Adjusting the significance level is unnecessary with multiple tests

18. When is it important to apply multiple hypothesis testing corrections?  
A) When performing a single hypothesis test  
B) When testing multiple hypotheses on the same data set  X
C) When the p-value is very small  
D) When confidence intervals are wide
