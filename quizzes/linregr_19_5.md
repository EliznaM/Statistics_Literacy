QUIZ FOR CORRELATION AND LIN REGR, 19.5

For each of the statement below, state whether it is TRUE or FALSE.  

a) The experimental groups in this analysis were people receiving treatment
for Covid-19 vs people not receiving treatment.  F
b) The experimental groups in this analysis were people with severe 
Covid-19 vs people with milder disease.  T
c) The researchers state that they found 7941 significantly differentially ex-
pressed genes (DEGs) after multiple testing correction. This means that they 
performed many thousands more linear models, 1 for each gene, and of those, 7941 
had an adjusted p-value (FDR) below 0.05.  T
d) In figure 2, the y-axis is a transformation of the FDR: the negative of 
the log base 10 of the FDR was calculated and plotted. This is done as correction
for multiple testing.   F
e) d) In figure 2, the y-axis is a transformation of the FDR: the negative of 
the log base 10 of the FDR was calculated and plotted. This is done to make the 
p-values smaller to filter out false positives.  F
f) d) In figure 2, the y-axis is a transformation of the FDR: the negative of 
the log base 10 of the FDR was calculated and plotted. This is done to put the
p-values on a scale that makes plotting easier.  T
g) In figure 2, each dot that is coloured red, represents one gene, for which
the mean expression in the severe cases, were higher than the mean expression 
in the mild cases, and the difference was statistically significant.  T
h) In figure 2, only the dots coloured green represent genes that had 
statistically significant differences in gene expression between severe and 
mild disease.  F
i) In figure 2, every red dot represents one gene that had higher expression than
the blue dots, and the difference was statistically significant.  F  
j) In figure 2, the p-values represent the results of comparisons of every gene
with every other gene, within the severe disease group.  F
k) in the method section of this paper, the authors give enough information 
about the edgeR analysis, so that someone else with the same data, could 
reproduce their analysis.   F
